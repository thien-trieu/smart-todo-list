# Smart To-Do Web Application
=========

When you are recommended something it's not always easy to jot it down for later in an organized fashion. Adding the item to your phone or computer ends up taking time and opening up the right app is only part of the problem. You then have to locate the right list ("Movies to watch", "Books to read", etc.) to add to. And if you do get it in to the right list, you don't have much more context about it. This delay and lack of additional information acts as a huge deterrent.

The solution? A smart, auto-categorizing todo list app. The user simply has to add the name of the thing, and it gets put into the correct list.

## Getting Started

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information 
  - username: `labber` 
  - password: `labber` 
  - database: `midterm`
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
5. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB
7. Run the server: `npm run local`
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
8. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Warnings & Use Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`.
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `widgets.js`.
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples. 
- Use helper functions to run your SQL queries and clean up any data coming back from the database. See `db/queries` for pre-populated examples.
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds. 
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database. 
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.

## Features

### The Landing Page

The primary use of the Smart To Do app is simply to add, browse, and complete items on a to do list via a simple user interface. As to-do lists are often personalized and private, Smart To-Do utilizes an encrypted **bcryptjs** user login experience. When a user first visits our site, the following landing page will appear:

Visitors may click on the Start Here button, or the Login or Register buttons on the navigation bar's right hand side. 

### The Registration Page

Upon clicking Start Here or Register, users are prompted to share their name and email address, create a strong password, and to update their city. By default, if the user has allowed their location data to be collected, the city should auto-populate based on the latitude and longitude of their IP address. This utilizes the free API **"Big Data Cloud"** to return the city to the system, and the main purpose of this API is to pass the city into the Yelp API which searches local restaurant names in order to better categorize to do memos.

***NOTE: Location browser data does not need to be shared and users may update their city to any location manually on this page or the Profile Edit page.***
